## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Richard!

I'm a software engineer with a background in business and as a practicing attorney. Along the way, I built a strong foundation in analysis, precision, and strategic problem-solving ‚Äî skills shaped by tackling complex, high-stakes business and legal challenges.

Today, I bring that same rigor to engineering:  
- I write clean, maintainable code with a focus on real-world impact.  
- I understand systems not just technically, but also from the perspectives of scalability, usability, and business value.  
- I love building efficient tools that help individuals and teams work smarter.

I'm driven by curiosity, collaboration, and a constant desire to improve ‚Äî whether it's refining a codebase, architecting a better system, or learning a new technology.

Most recently, I co-created [Nimbus](https://nimbusnlp.github.io/), an open-source framework for deploying lightweight NLP models easily and efficiently.  
If you're interested, I also authored an [in-depth technical case study](https://nimbusnlp.github.io/docs/introduction) detailing the engineering challenges, design process, and system architecture behind Nimbus.
